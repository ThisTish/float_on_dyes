			plastic: 'Total Eclipse Glow',
			description: "Mesmerizingly straight, with flight numbers of 5/5/-1/1, the Hex will find a place in anyoneâ€™s bag as a versatile and reliably straight midrange. At the highest arm speeds, the Hex will produce slightly understable lines from flat, but the 1 fade keeps it from flipping over completely. For lower arm speeds, the Hex has enough turn to make shaping lines a breeze. If you are looking for control in the woods, or simply a versatile line shaper, the Hex is the midrange for you.",
